# Neighborhood-Map
It is single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood. I did add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations (Foursquare's tips) and various ways to browse the content.

## Requirements
In order to run this program you will need the following:

1. Computer (Windows or Mac OS).
2. Internet access.
3. Browser

## Instructions

1. Open index.html in your browser.
2. You can click on the markers on the map that will show a window where you can read a tip from Foursquare.
3. You can also filter the restaurants you are interested in by typing in the input. The Map will update accordingly showing the restaurants filtered.
4. Enjoy!
